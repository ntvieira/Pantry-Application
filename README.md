Pantry-Application is an android application our group designed to enhance the user's ability to maintain what they have in their inventory, as well as make shopping easier.  <br/><br/>
It was developed in Android Studio and uses Google Firebase (NoSQL) as its backend, Google Vision for barcode scanning, with Facebook, Google, and user email login options to sign in.  <br/><br/>
Our goal was to increase the user's ability to keep track of what is in their inventory. <br/>
<br/>You can run the app on an android phone by downloading our APK in the release section
<br/><br/><b>Getting started:</b>  <br/>
<br/>If you don't have an android, you can download android studio off the internet. If you are testing Google login or Facebook login you must run it from the APK.  This has to do with the SHA-1 fingerprints for compiling the app. <br/> <br/>
