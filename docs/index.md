# Welcome to PantryApp
PantryApp puts the ease back into grocery shopping again by keeping a running list of the items you need to pick up at your next shopping trip and lets you see what items you have at any given time for dinner that night

We hope PantryApp takes some of the hassle out of grocery shopping and meal planning throughout the week
## Enjoy!

Maintaining a pantry inventory is easy with PantryApp. You can add items by scanning barcodes, adding directly from your grocery list, or manually entering an item. To decrement the quantity of an item can be done by cliking on the item. Deleting an entire item from your pantry can be done by pressing and holding the item.

The scanner page allows you to scan any food item barcode. Most items in your pantry will already be in our data base and display this picture when scanned. Sometimes you will scan an item that is not in our database and you will see this screen. Simply fill out the fields with the correct information. For either option you will enter a quantity and the desired location of the item.
